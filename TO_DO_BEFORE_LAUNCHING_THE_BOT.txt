Hello/Hello, here are the steps to follow before doing anything with the bot!

To start, you must find the following files:

index.js
config.json
package.json

In each file (except json) everything is explained so that the configuration and programming of this bot
is the most fun.

Step 1 - Before use

Before using the bot please check that the npm command gives you something.
If windows returns an error it is because you do not have npm.

To get it please download node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/

After installing node.js, you must install the packages.
They allow the bot to perform complex tasks but also to run it.

We will have to install the packages contained in package.json as well as the packages contained in the index.js file

I list them below:

By default:
discord.js
moment
For the ban and the mute:
ms

To do this, you will open the console to launch the bot.bat and write to it

npm i discord.js moment

The two packages will install themselves.

WARNING! discord.js is a huge package! It contains about 30 to 40 packages so don't expect
what it takes to install in 10 seconds! Count several minutes instead!

As soon as everything is installed you will have to configure the config.json file.

#########################################

Step 2 - Configure the bot

Go to the config.json file.

You should have this:

{
"token": "The token of the bot",
"OwnerID": "Your ID",
"nivperms": "8", 
"prefix":"-", 
"OwnerName": "Your Username",
"BotName": "The name of the bot",
"version": "The bot version"
}

Please enter your discord ID (right-click on your nickname, Copy ID) instead of your ID.
nivperms indicates the permission level of the bot. 8 is the Administrator permission level.
You can change it by going here:
https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0

All you have to do is fill in your bot ID and click on boxes to give or remove permissions.
There is no point in adding more permissions than level 8 because that is the maximum level you can reach: D
So you can only remove some.

prefix is the bot prefix ( / $ // ? ! -- that we all bots before typing a command).
OwnerName is your username.
BotName is the name you want to give to the bot.
version is of course the bot version.

and finally... token.
Well, that's more complicated.

The token is the secret key to your bot.
It makes it possible to control it completely.
If it is stolen from you, the person will be able to do what they want to your bot.

Keep it carefully and did not put it visibly in the code (here it is in a file external to the code).

To get a token you have to go here:
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications

Log in with your discord account and create a bot like this:

New Application >

Name the bot and then:

Bot > Add Bot > Yes, do it!

Then click on Copy under Click to Reveal Token.

You just copied the token!
Put it in place of the sentence "The token of the bot".

You have finished configuring the config.json file!

Step 3 - Launch the bot

The bot is ready!

To launch it, click on to launch_the_bot.bat and write :

node index.js

The bot should launch correctly.

If there is an error, don't hesitate to report it to me on the Discord Pimp My Bot!

https://discord.me/pimpmybot

And if you could talk about Bot2Test around you it would be cool! The more people there are, the more we laugh!
